# Lab 3: Basic Logic Gates



Objective

&nbsp;   1. To understand and implement basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR) using Verilog HDL.

&nbsp;   2. To write simple Verilog modules for individual logic gates.

&nbsp;   3. To verify the functionality through testbenches and waveform simulations.
