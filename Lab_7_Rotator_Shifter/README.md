# Lab 7: Rotator and Shifter Design



Objective}

&nbsp;   1. To implement logical shifts, arithmetic shifts, and circular rotates in Verilog HDL.

&nbsp;   2. To understand and implement a barrel shifter capable of multi-bit shifts in a single cycle.

&nbsp;   3. To simulate and verify the operation of shifters, rotators, and barrel shifters.
