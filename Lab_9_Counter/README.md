# Lab 9: Counters and Clock Divider Design



Objective

&nbsp;   1. To design and simulate synchronous binary counters using Verilog HDL.

&nbsp;   2. To implement a clock divider to generate slower clocks from a system clock.

&nbsp;   3. To verify functionality through simulation and waveform observation.
