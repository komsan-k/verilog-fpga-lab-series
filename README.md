# Verilog and FPGA Lab Series

This repository contains a structured set of laboratory exercises designed to support hands-on learning in Verilog HDL and FPGA-based digital design. These labs align with introductory-to-intermediate level coursework and are compatible with development tools like Xilinx Vivado and boards such as the Nexys A7.
