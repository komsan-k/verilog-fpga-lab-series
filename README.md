# Verilog and FPGA Lab Series

This repository contains a structured set of laboratory exercises designed to support hands-on learning in Verilog HDL and FPGA-based digital design. These labs align with introductory-to-intermediate level coursework and are compatible with development tools like Xilinx Vivado and boards such as the Nexys A7.

---
## Objectives

- Develop hands-on skills in Verilog HDL and FPGA-based circuit design.
- Use Xilinx Vivado and Nexys A7 boards for implementing digital logic systems.
- Apply combinational and sequential design principles in practical lab experiments.
