# Lab 10: FSM Design for Serial Adder



Objective

&nbsp;   1. To design a serial adder using Finite State Machine (FSM) methodology in Verilog HDL.

&nbsp;   2. To simulate and verify the functionality of the FSM-based serial adder.

&nbsp;   2. To understand the control mechanism for sequential arithmetic using FSM design.
